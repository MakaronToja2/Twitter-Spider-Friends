It was made as an exercise during my lectures on freecodecamp. We had to create our own as teacher called it Twitter spider and connect it with SQLite database so he can catch all 100friends from person whom we typed and if we did not type anythig it takes random person which was not already taken from the database and uploads his/hers 100friends from Twitter.
I did not personally made twurl  and oauth. I know oauth can be found on internet but teacher provide us with those files and in hidden (which I cannot upload because it has my keys to Twitter API's) I downloaded from Twitter developer.
